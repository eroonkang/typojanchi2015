 Here, Now, and Waiting is a memorial sign that aims to commemorate Jongno, a district in Seoul, Korea where young people held street demonstrations to establish a democratic society in the late 80’s and early 90’s. At that time, Jongno was often filled with young people who wanted to reform unjust and corrupt politics in Korea. I remember that the police and military cracked down on the protesters by shooting tear gas and water cannons in Jongno. Furthermore, in order to weaken and oppress civil power, the government had police chase protesters and lock them in police stations. The rest of the participants marched to Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral to avoid oppression and to continue to raise public awareness. This is the most intense and memorable scene of Jongno in my mind. In other words, Jongno was a symbolic place where people continued to bring about democratic awareness.
 Now, the people who were young at that time are in their 40s and have made cultural, social, political, and economical changes over time. Jongno district is one of them. It has become one of the most spectacular and global streets in Korea. The current scene of Jongno is that people move faster and faster to make a living and tourists come and go all the time. However, it is uncertain whether these tremendous changes and faster city living is what the young people had fought and waited for. 
 Thus, this project is an attempt to reflect on the emancipatory time of the street and commemorates its youth by using an aphoristic text, Now and Here, which the young people often used in the democratic movements. This memorial sign consists of several words made out of Hangeul vowels and consonants - the Korean alphabet - that can be interpreted Here, Now, and Waiting. In order to visualize the flow of time, the letters are attached to clock movements behind the front panel of the sign. In the design outcome, the letters constantly rotate on the front panel constructing and destructing the words, Here, Now, and Waiting. It asks what we are waiting for to come here and now.
