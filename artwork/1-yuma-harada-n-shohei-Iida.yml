 We focus on the designs created as the result of a city and the phenomenon that seems to connect their surrounding environment, then display the process we have experimented repeatedly. In a city, there is always something being planned, distributing, being maintained then gradually fading away. Such circulation is occurring sporadically. We observe that space between a city and an environment, also before and after each process. Then we admire the last-minute figure before it becomes a certain form and the things that probably used to have a shape, and believe that shedding a light on them would make something that has been overlooked to rise up again. We are trying to converse with an approachable city by picking up and exchanging exactly “what we have now” hiding in our daily lives.
