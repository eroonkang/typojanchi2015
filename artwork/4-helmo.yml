 Evocation of a city, using text only (official informations to promote the Biennale). The poster represents our relation to typography in the city, somewhere between fascination for its complexity and nauseous saturation. We designed the 2 typefaces used in the poster : the main one, "Grand Rue", is inspired by city reclined letters painted on road's  asphalt in France ; the second one, "Palais", is a variation of a dot typeface we've designed for Palais de Tokyo visual identity (museum of contemporary arts in Paris).
