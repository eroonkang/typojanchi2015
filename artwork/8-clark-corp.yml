 A welcoming gesture is one of the fundamental ways of establishing goodwill between people. There are the universal basics of hospitality; providing for a guest's needs, making them feel comfortable and secure, treating them with respect. 

 If etiquette requires providing for the comfort and security of one's guests, perhaps a deeper sort of welcome comes when a host invites them to transcend their comfort and routine and try on a new experience. Even when visiting a very different place, the environments designed for travelers are often a sea of similarity: airports, bus stations, taxis, hotels; these spaces are designed to work for the broadest set of people and therefore show little variation from place to place. But one of the most profound aspects of visiting another culture is the ability of the experience to stretch your perspective - the traveller, separated from their normal life and set of cultural expectations, is free to try on novel ways of acting and prioritizing. For us, the best hosts makes their guests welcome by opening up their own lives, allowing the visitor to see what it might be like to live as another. 

 In the context of the hotel, we've attempted to translate this sharing of perspectives into three sets of objects. A riff on traditional hotel welcome objects (shoehorn, soap, chocolate, minibar snacks etc.), our welcome cases are designed not just to meet basic needs or satisfy late night munchies, but to direct experience: a guest chooses one of three numbered envelopes; inside they find a single word representing the direction we hope to take their evening, and the code to one of the three cases. The themes of the three cases are Hedonism, Tranquility and Voyeurism, and the objects in them have been chosen to facilitate a multi-faceted experience around those themes, all within the confines of the room. Our aim is that these objects will serve as a proxy host, offering a tasting menu of possible experience and suggesting a perspective around which to frame the guest's activities. As the visitor explores the city, and when they return to their home, we hope that they might consider taking this perspective with them.

 Enjoy your stay! -ClarkCorp
