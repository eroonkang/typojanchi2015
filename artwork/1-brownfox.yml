 “Formular” in Russian, German and some other languages means “blank”, “template”, “form" for documents to fill in some data. The form's grid should be flexible and functional. You can add any information into the gaps or simply leave them empty. There are two similar boxes in the centre of the posters: the one is filled by the pictures with Soviet architecture and graphic; the box in the second poster is empty, just crossed by a diagonal like you do it when you have no requested information. The rest space includes the information about the Formular typeface.
