# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

artwork_desc_en: >
 The city is a structure whose character is shaped in tune with the needs and desires of its inhabitants. It never reaches a final form but is in constant change – a mix of the old and the new, of order and chaos, of things that work and things that don’t.  In this environment of continuous transformation, citizens are in need of well-functioning systems in order function efficiently, to work, and to feel secure.

 With our proposal for Typojanchi 2015, we want to focus on the authoritative experience such systems transmit in public places – in this case the former gateway to Seoul. 

 By employing a familiar everyday object – the common and well-known queue management system – we want to challenge people’s habitual patterns which are so difficult to break. Most of us tend to follow instructions as prescribed. 

 By installing the system in irrational formations, the visitors are encouraged to follow a playfully tracked path. Texts play a key role in directing the visitor beyond preconceived expectations. Through a careful play with semantics, we aim to put the visitor in awkward, paradoxical or seemingly meaningless kafkaesque situations that give rise to a kind of understated humor and awareness of the absurd. Strange, embarrassing or silly situations that arise from an impulsive behavior based on blind faith and obedience.

 The purpose of our intervention at the Cultural Station Seoul 284 is to invite the audience into a playful, performative, sculptural piece and give opportunity to reflect over their own automatical responses in authoritative public situations.

 Our goal is to raise the audience awareness of the visual language of the city with use of an underlying laconic wit.

 We would ideally like to have these small installations spread on several locations at the Cultural Station.

 Texts on signs yet to come.

 “Research and Development are not lazy yet avoid doing very much. Like a well educated person who can say a great deal without saying very much, they employ an economy of means. A straight line drawn freehand using a pencil with a sharp point, a definite solution, fixed with purpose and preci- sion, very specific. There are many reds and many tones of gray, they always select the exact right one. This is subjective, but the results resonate with a purposeful authoritative objectiveness that leaves the viewer in no doubt they made the right choice.” — Daniel Eatock, excerpt from Book, published by Eastside Projects as part of Book Show, 2010
