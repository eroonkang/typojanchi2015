 # ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------


artwork_desc_en: >
 Lynwood Interchange, FW710-105. In an environment without typography, different scales of the location and its architecture (shapes, structure and materials) have been used in order to generate a visual language.

# PARTICIPANT -----------------------------------------------

participant_bio_en: >
 French graphic designer based in London. (2011) 
 Graduating student from the Royal College of Art, MA Visual Communication 2014. My practice is defined by my interest of 'de-composing/re-composing'  my surroundings but also by questioning the physicality of our (graphic) mediums. I often look at my productions as if they were objects rather than printed information.
