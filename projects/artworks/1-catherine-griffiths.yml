 AEIOU—Constructed/Projected is the fourth work in the Vowel series. Constructed/Projected is a new work made in response to C(   )T(   ), and the Biennale theme of city and typography. Layers of interaction involving collected numbers, letters, words, phrases—found and constructed—with the human body, are presented as a short film, with objects* propped and stacked, nearby.
