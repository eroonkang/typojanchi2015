# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

artwork_desc_en: >
 AEIOU—Constructed/Projected is the fourth work in the Vowel series. Constructed/Projected is a new work made in response to C(   )T(   ), and the Biennale theme of city and typography. Layers of interaction involving collected numbers, letters, words, phrases—found and constructed—with the human body, are presented as a short film, with objects* propped and stacked, nearby.

 Catherine Griffiths (b.1966) lives and works in Auckland, and sometimes Paris. She is an independent designer and typographer. Her work is a mix of typographic installations in public and private spaces, visual communication design, self-publishing, and occasional writing on design. She works with artists, architects and designers, scientists and engineers, assists students, lectures and hosts occasional workshops, including the compact typ gr ph c series. Projects of note include the Wellington Writers Walk, a series of large-scale concrete text sculptures, her ongoing Vowel series (‘AEIOU’, ‘Sound Tracks’, ‘Fifth Movement’), TypeSHED11—New Zealand’s first ever international typography symposium, and the design (and build) of a small house and two studios. Recent work includes a mirror-faced, brass-backed ‘O’ suspended in space, the design of a small park, and twice being short-listed on teams for the Venice Architecture Biennale (New Zealand 2014, and Australia for 2016). She contributed the letter ‘U’ to the Fitchburg Alphabet Project, with 25 other international typographers. In November, ‘Body of Work’, a new edition from Vapour Momenta Books, the pocket-sized publishing arm of Catherine and photographer Bruce Connew, will be released.
