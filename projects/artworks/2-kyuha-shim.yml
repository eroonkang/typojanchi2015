artwork_desc_en: >
 The system will utilise both texts (written by Adrian) and poster designs (done by six students) as inputs for the semantic analysis, and they will be integrated with real-time data of each city collected via online APIs in order to draw cohesive and iterative pictures of each city in real-time.
