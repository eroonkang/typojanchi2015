# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

 It is about the concept of the 'other', the influence on behavior by the the idea of someone else watching you. It seems to be a strong cultural element in Korea. This example is interesting because it is so literal and so direct. It is a physical manifestation of the invisible 'other'. The typography (in addition to the mirror) represents the physical form of the 'conscience'. It is used in many neighborhoods and even lights up at night. The public form of 'your conscience' is in this mirror sign. The typography included.
 The main typography of the mirror: 당신의 양심 (Your Conscience). We will be referencing a few philosophical concepts in relation to the cultural concepts. The typography part, will be the idea that the form of the words in public become the face of the meaning. All of this is still being worked out. I like the idea because the concept of the 'other' is always in every gallery and museum too. "Am I looking at this correctly?" "Is this art?" "I totally get it... I think." "Does everyone get this?" "Am I the only one who doesn't?".
