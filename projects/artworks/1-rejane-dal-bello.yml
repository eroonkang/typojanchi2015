# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

artwork_desc_en: >
 Life is in constant change and we cannot control it, but it seams we can definitely destroy it. Google maps preserves the image of the earth by cherishing it and documenting its beauty. It is grandiose for us to navigate and learn more about our home we live in. The satellite images makes the earth an abstract form, ready for you to interpret and give a new meaning to rivers, which from a certain distance becomes a paintbrush of a painter, the landscape becomes a surreal place as if the world is pure a work of art. The Earth Art project takes the world and makes it immortal, respectful like a pure piece of art in a gallery. We are forgetting how holy is the place we live in and how important is to be aware of it. I hope from this work that the common tool of looking at our planet via Google earth becomes again something special – a state of art.
