 # ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

artwork_desc_en: >
 The starting point of this work is a store front in Shinjuku. Its sign set in a calligraphic font reads like a dadaist poem – Hermès Louis Vuitton Rolex Cartier Bvlgari Chanel – a mantra made of brands that have become stronger than the impersonal objects they produce. The empty slogan provides absolution through consumerism. With its patterns lifted from luxury goods and its simplified messages in Japanese, this banner works like an oversized banknote for empty dreams.

# PARTICIPANT -----------------------------------------------

participant_bio_en: >
 Jonas Berthod lives and works between London and Switzerland. He runs an independent practice dealing with his overlapping interests in design, research and teaching. His studio is based on a model of a fluid system, formed of loose collaborations without a vertical organisation. Research, as an integral part of his practice, is explored through self-directed design projects (The Brick), giving talks and workshops (at RCA, ECAL and SUPSI) or writing (for magazines or speculatively). He is a lecturer in Critical History of Design at ECAL, Lausanne. His current research interests cover sociopolitical issues around the theme of living in London today.
