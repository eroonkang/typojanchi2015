# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------


artwork_desc_en: >
 The collage of diverse elements brings together all the fascinating differences in language in/output -  the more diversely crossed, the more alluring and climatic the language layering and paralleling or misplacement of the Da-da Phenomenon gets. 

 This kind of phenomenon also includes many visible and fantastic forms of “signs, symbols, literatures, typographies, strange encodings, or even unreadable characters” – appearing on the same surface (space) at the same time and then forming a visually transmitted “co-exhibit” imaginative space.
