  에런 니에(aka 용첸 니에)는 타이완 국립기술대학교를 졸업했으며 타이완 국립예술대학교 대학원에서 응용 미디어아트를 수학했다. 미묘한 세부를 다루면서도 매우 도발적이고 야심찬 시각적 결과물을 만들어내는 그의 작업은 출판과 공연 예술, 만다린 팝 뮤직계에 참신한 상상력을 제공하며 새로운 풍경을 형성하고 있다. 2012년부터 AGI 회원으로 활동하고 있다.

    The collage of diverse elements brings together all the fascinating differences in language in/output -  the more diversely crossed, the more alluring and climatic the language layering and paralleling or misplacement of the Da-da Phenomenon gets. This kind of phenomenon also includes many visible and fantastic forms of “signs, symbols, literatures, typographies, strange encodings, or even unreadable characters” – appearing on the same surface (space) at the same time and then forming a visually transmitted “co-exhibit” imaginative space.
