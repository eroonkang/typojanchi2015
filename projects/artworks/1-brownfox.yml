# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

artwork_desc_en: >
 “Formular” in Russian, German and some other languages means “blank”, “template”, “form" for documents to fill in some data. The form's grid should be flexible and functional. You can add any information into the gaps or simply leave them empty. There are two similar boxes in the centre of the posters: the one is filled by the pictures with Soviet architecture and graphic; the box in the second poster is empty, just crossed by a diagonal like you do it when you have no requested information. The rest space includes the information about the Formular typeface.

# PARTICIPANT -----------------------------------------------

 Independent type foundry Brownfox offers a fresh perspective on Latin and Cyrillic fonts. We have a solid track record with text fonts optimised for on-screen reading, as well as with print fonts. Our work is firmly rooted in the typographic tradition, yet is unmistakably current. We aspire to create fonts of the highest degree of craftsmanship and up to the latest technical standards. The outcome that we pursue in our work – to augment familiar with something new. The most important thing for us is to find a new, bright, compelling and unique character of typefaces. One of the challenges here is to stay within the group of typefaces, called workhorses, fonts that cover a broad range of application areas.
