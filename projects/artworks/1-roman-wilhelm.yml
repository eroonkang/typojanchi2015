# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

artwork_desc_en: >
 In history, different writing systems evolved alongside the languages they used to visualize, in cultural contexts connected to certain geographic spaces (such as the Chinese or Korean scripts). But parallel to that development, expansion politics also brought writing systems to new places, where they too continued to evolve (such as the Greek script in Ptolemaic Egypt, the Latin script throughout the Roman empire or – different – in Vietnam). The metropolis of the 20th and 21st century brings about a very different idea of culture space, re-contextualizing all sorts of languages and scripts on signboards alongside each other, making this transcultural mix more defining for the perception of the city than alleged “native” elements of visual culture.

 In Berlin, all the Turkish and Arabic shops, supermarkets, bars and restaurants alongside Sonnenallee and Karl-Marx-Straße (Neukölln district) make you feel like in Istanbul or Jerusalem, but alongside other signals of visual culture (be it German shops or Vietnamese restaurants), they define that specific part of Berlin, attracting tourists from all over the world. 

 Urban typography seems to warp geographic space. If typographic signals in urban space were voices, then how would these voices sound together?

 This visual investigation starts at Berlin’s Oranien street in Kreuzberg district, where German shopfronts and letterings coexist with the Turkish. The nearby “Hong Kong Shop” is not run by Chinese, same for the “China Box” noodle store. However, these little visual hints trigger a reflection on the visual culture of Chinese cities where I frequently stay: Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. The samples shown here reflect recent visual researches I did in the context of different art and design projects, all reflecting political or cultural urban space, or the cultural universe of writing and type.

 Despite the different city names, the whole works reflects a mindmap of an urban space in Berlin that I am walking around in, carrying all my visual cultural notions, connotations and memories with me whereever I go, showing the tense entanglement in the fabric of urban typography. This collection has been planned as a highly individual, Berlin-based visual menu for a typo banquet (잔치).

 A booklet shaped like a city map accompanies the wall poster, providing more information and translations of the respective content.

 The adjacent musical piece “The Fabric of Entanglement (Berlinistanbulhongkongshanghaibeijing…)” consists of five parts, according to the poster. The music is based on on-site recordings of urban noise (Muzak) and is meant to lift the visual experience on a more real-time basis.

 Roman Wilhelm *1976 in Germany

 Roman studied visual communication at Burg Giebichenstein University of Art and Design Halle, and under Prof. Fred Smeijers (typeface design master class) at the Academy of Visual Arts in Leipzig, Germany. Since 2005 he is an art director for INSIDE A Communications AG, Berlin & Beijing. He has been teaching and conducting workshops at diverse art and design institutions in Germany, Italy, Poland, China and Korea. From 2008 to 2013, he was a member of the Multilingual Typography Research Group (general lead: Prof. Dr. Ruedi Baur) at the Zurich University of the Arts, later at HEAD Geneva, Switzerland. He was an artist in residence at the Hong Kong Baptist University, Academy of Visual Arts in 2015. His first digital Chinese typeface “Laowai Sung (老外宋)” has been published by Arphic (文鼎), Taiwan, in 2015. Being a fluent Chinese speaker, Roman uses his language skills as much as possible during his frequent teaching and research stays in China. In 2008, he became a founding member of “Shanghai Flaneur”, a walking think-tank on the city of Shanghai, where he has been developing guided city labs on Shanghai’s role in the history and present of Asian typography and media, leading him to curate and edit a special issue of the Germany “Typotopografie” (typo-topography) magazine exclusively focusing on Shanghai.
