# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------


artwork_desc_en: >
 We decided to work with three of our posters, which were made for three different cities. From each poster we extracted all graphic elements. These three layers were all scaled proportionally and then put on top of each other. The resulting composition resembles a dense urban construct, a typographic city.
