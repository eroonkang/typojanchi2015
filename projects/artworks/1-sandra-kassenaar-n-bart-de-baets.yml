 # ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

artwork_desc_en: >
 Being surrounded by letters and images from existing graphic languages makes that when visiting places the usual touristic sights aren't our main priority. Artists, designers-or just the two of us — look at the things around us and store'em, in the hope they inspire our design and art work back home in studio.

 For the exhibition we will take home a selection of these physical urban typographic discoveries and make an attempt to lay them out on a white wall. What happens when a idea leaves a designer’s computer and is printed on backs of trucks-for-example-is a question that inspired the piece we will presented at the Typojanchi Biennale.On a life-size photographic print you see two designers trying to deal with their typographic inspirations.
 
 It’s a work in which the actual size of things stands for the sometimes problematic relation with inspira- tion. Inspiration is confused with plain old copying, the issue finding ways of appropriating it, one way or the other is an issue worth ponder- ing over.
