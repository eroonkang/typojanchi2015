artwork_desc_en: >
 City surrounding us has always wearing a Typography. We – Dainippon Type Organization – also continue to work around the Typography.

 If this character is gone from the world, it will become what the world?

 2005, Dainippon Type Organization has produced works that were left off the characters from the city of Tokyo.

 After 10 years, this time we'll leave off the letter from the city of Seoul in the same way.When Seoul and Tokyo become next to each other without letters, what really look how?This Installation, also flow Karaoke video that was made for this. Karaoke no vocal accompaniment only, it also like a city vanished in character.
