 # ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

 If one is about to read a city, Typography are considered as the interface of it, Words, which are different from books, City typography are connected more closely with local group's daily life and culture history.

 Chinese cities might differ from cities in other countries (e.g. South Korea), because of their distinct developmental stage, Rich and poor, tradition and modern are layered and mixed at one moment, which allows new possibilities of typography.

 I ever have travelled a lot in several remotely small towns of Shanxi province in western China, where I was fascinated by the door curtains that made by local housewives by hand in the form of “baina”(百纳）, Ladies used small pieces of remaining cloth at home or collected trimmings to sew together so that they can make kinds of new looking curtains—with modern palette and structures where also implied with words. Thus, these works turned into modern and abstract paintings. And in those small towns, the existence of words in walls, bricks, rooms and living space provided us with more imaginations for typography. 

 By reconstructing these elements, Chinese typography also indicate that people in Chinese cities will live a new life, Wandering between traditional and modern times.
