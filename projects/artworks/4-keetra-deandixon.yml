# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------


artwork_desc_en: >
 Typography reflects the laying of culture flowing through the architecture of a city. Some messages are more ephemeral and had made, some systemized and executed with tremendous consideration, all building up one another to create a rich portrait of the people who dwell within a cities walls and move through it’s passage ways. Words stack up layer after layers, a quickly evolving communique that echoes the movement of life in a city.

# PARTICIPANT -----------------------------------------------

participant_bio_en: >
 Keetra Dean Dixon is a designer and artist who relocated from NYC to rural Alaska in 2014 where she tests the claim “I can work from anywhere” by building a new studio practice with a remote home base. Dixon traded in her team leading role as an Experiential Design Director for more independent practices, including Lettering, Sculpture, and Product Design. Her hybrid design background continues to lead her work towards speculative terrain, leveraging emergent technologies and process focused making. 

 Dixon has been recognized on several fronts including a U.S. presidential award, a place in the permanent design collection at the SFMOMA, and the honorable ranking of ADC Young Gun. Her clients have included NYTimes, Nike, VW, and Coach. She’s shown at the Walker Art Center, the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt, and the Museum of Arts and Design in NYC and can often be found waxing poetic in front of student bodies and fellow makers.
