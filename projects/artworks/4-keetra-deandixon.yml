 Typography reflects the laying of culture flowing through the architecture of a city. Some messages are more ephemeral and had made, some systemized and executed with tremendous consideration, all building up one another to create a rich portrait of the people who dwell within a cities walls and move through it’s passage ways. Words stack up layer after layers, a quickly evolving communique that echoes the movement of life in a city.
