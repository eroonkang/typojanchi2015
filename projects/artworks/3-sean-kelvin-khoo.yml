 Pupilpeople (Pp.) is a design studio based in Singapore. We develop printed and digital communications for academic institutions, arts and cultural organisations, non-profits, commercial and government bodies. Pp. values research, open communication and client collaboration as much as the final outcome. We respond to content by examining, experimenting and reconstructing them to better communicate the messages within. This approach allows us to build practical and effective responses that best fit the unique objectives of each individual project.
 The studio was founded in 2008 by Sean Kelvin Khoo (Creative Director) and Nicole Ong (Studio Manager), and the team currently includes Gideon Kong (Graphic Designer), Adelia Lim (Graphic Designer) and Jamie Yeo (Industrial Designer). Since 2012, Sean has been engaged as an adjunct faculty at Temasek Polytechnic School of Design, teaching subjects like Typography, Publication Design, as well as providing guidance for students tackling their final year projects. He was previously in an adjunct position at Orita Sinclair School of Design, New Media & the Arts. Sean is also a partner in local Risograph press, Push—Press.
