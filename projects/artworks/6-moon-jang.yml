# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

 Here, Now, and Waiting is a memorial sign that aims to commemorate Jongno, a district in Seoul, Korea where young people held street demonstrations to establish a democratic society in the late 80’s and early 90’s. At that time, Jongno was often filled with young people who wanted to reform unjust and corrupt politics in Korea. I remember that the police and military cracked down on the protesters by shooting tear gas and water cannons in Jongno. Furthermore, in order to weaken and oppress civil power, the government had police chase protesters and lock them in police stations. The rest of the participants marched to Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral to avoid oppression and to continue to raise public awareness. This is the most intense and memorable scene of Jongno in my mind. In other words, Jongno was a symbolic place where people continued to bring about democratic awareness.
 Now, the people who were young at that time are in their 40s and have made cultural, social, political, and economical changes over time. Jongno district is one of them. It has become one of the most spectacular and global streets in Korea. The current scene of Jongno is that people move faster and faster to make a living and tourists come and go all the time. However, it is uncertain whether these tremendous changes and faster city living is what the young people had fought and waited for. 
 Thus, this project is an attempt to reflect on the emancipatory time of the street and commemorates its youth by using an aphoristic text, Now and Here, which the young people often used in the democratic movements. This memorial sign consists of several words made out of Hangeul vowels and consonants - the Korean alphabet - that can be interpreted Here, Now, and Waiting. In order to visualize the flow of time, the letters are attached to clock movements behind the front panel of the sign. In the design outcome, the letters constantly rotate on the front panel constructing and destructing the words, Here, Now, and Waiting. It asks what we are waiting for to come here and now.

 My primary research focuses on narrative design that explores design systems, methods, and forms to create multiple visual narratives. In my work, I study the relationships between multiple narratives and simultaneity, transformation, duality, modularity, polyhedralness1, and ambivalence as visual concepts. These studies allow me to discover metaphorical perspectives, to pay attention to everyday objects, and to visualize non-visible information (such as temperature) in order to understand its meaning. As a result, I created a series of design and artwork through a wide range of media such as digital prints (posters), books, typefaces, and animations achieving the visual concepts in multiple narratives: The Metamorphosis of a Minor Arc I, The Color of Athens Weather, A Sequence of Gray, A Sequence of C, M, and Y, The Politics of Alignment, etc.

 I presented papers at national and international design and design & art education conferences. My presentations include my research projects and teaching practices and emphasize various color approaches, uses of color systems, and polyhedral forms in building multiple visual narratives: Color Semantics in Building Multiple Visual Narratives (SECAC Conference, 2014), Polyhedralness as Multiple Narratives and The Optics of the Invisible: A Pedagogical Exploration in Multi-sensory Design (UCDA Design Education Summit 2013 and 2014).

 In addition, I was invited to artist and designer presentations and to conduct workshops nationally and internationally: I presented Form as Narrative (2013) and Color Value in Space-Time (2014) at the Annual Conference Kutztown University; and lectured A Sequence of Gray (2014) at Hongik University in Korea; Decentralization (2012), Yangon, Myanmar.
