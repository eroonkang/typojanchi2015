# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------


artwork_desc_en: >
 What is a spätkauf? Basically, it’s a convenience store. A 7-11 of sorts. They’re not specific to Berlin, but in Berlin, there’s at least a späti on every street. People typically stop in a späti on their way out, on their way home, or on their way anywhere. In a city where public drinking isn’t policed, beers-to-go are popular. And often a part of just about any night out on the town—whether you’re clubbing or just hanging out with friends.

# PARTICIPANT -----------------------------------------------

participant_bio_en: >
 Siggi Eggertsson was born in Akureyri, a small town on the north coast of Iceland. He first showed an interest in Graphic Design at the age of 14 when he became involved in local design programs creating posters for jazz concerts and art exhibitions. When he turned 18, his vision started to expand beyond his remote home, so he applied to the Iceland Academy of Arts in Reykjavik to study Graphic Design. During his first year he met the typographer Atli Hilmarsson and they began working together on design briefs. Here Siggi Eggertsson developed not only as a typographer and designer but also, increasingly, as an Illustrator and image maker in his own right. In 2005 he moved to New York to work at the Karlssonwilker design studio followed by a move to Berlin to study in the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weissensee.
 Early in 2007 Siggi moved to London to become part of the Big Active family and contribute to publications like Dazed and Confused, The New York Times and Arkitip plus commercial work with H&M, Stussy and various music projects. In 2008 Siggi moved back to Berlin, where he still lives and works. Siggi has a unique and complete visual identity; his approach to work takes in his design background, which results in work of hidden depth and sense of purpose.
