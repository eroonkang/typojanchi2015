 What is a spätkauf? Basically, it’s a convenience store. A 7-11 of sorts. They’re not specific to Berlin, but in Berlin, there’s at least a späti on every street. People typically stop in a späti on their way out, on their way home, or on their way anywhere. In a city where public drinking isn’t policed, beers-to-go are popular. And often a part of just about any night out on the town—whether you’re clubbing or just hanging out with friends.
