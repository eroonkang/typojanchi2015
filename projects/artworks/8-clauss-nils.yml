  Nils brings a clean style and clear point of view to his work. His strong sense of visual storytelling is driven by the fact that he found his way into directing through cinematography and photography.

  Based in Seoul, South Korea, Nils has shot, directed and edited a number of award-winning music videos, short, feature and documentary films, which have been screened at various international festivals or went viral online. He often collaborates with Irish filmmaker Neil Dowling to develop concepts and the duo have created a number of hit music videos like Moonchild for M83, as well as Senior Living for the Norwegian band Röyksopp which was selected for the prestigious Saatchi & Saatchi’s New Directors’ Showcase at Cannes in 2011 and received a nomination at the UK Music Video Awards the same year.

  After studying in Germany, Australia and Hong Kong, Nils honed his technical skills and fierce work ethic by completing his MFA in Cinematography at the Graduate School of Advanced Imaging Science, Multimedia and Film at Chungang University in Seoul. Born and raised in Germany, Nils has been living in South Korea since the end of 2005. This gave him a unique world perspective and has liberated his views from any form of ethnocentrism. Nils is steadfast in his quest to experience the authenticity of all walks of life and to work within challenging and diverse environments.
