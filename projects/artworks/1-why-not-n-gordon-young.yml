 Why Not Associates
 On leaving the Royal College of Art in 1987 fellow students Andy Altmann, David Ellis and Howard Greenhalgh formed the multi disciplinary design group Why Not Associates. In over 25 years of experience they have worked on projects ranging from exhibition design to postage stamps via advertising, publishing, television titles, commercials, corporate identity and public art. Why Not Associates clients include the Royal Academy of Arts, Malcolm Mcclaren, Pompidou Centre, Royal Mail, Nike, Paul Smith, Virgin Records, Antony Gormley, BBC, Channel 4 and the Tate Modern. In 1991 Why Not Associates collaborated with Edward Booth-Clibborn and Rick Poyner to edit and design Typography Now: The Next wave – which became the most significant, most referenced, best selling survey of typographic trends and thinking of its time. A monograph was published in 1998 by Booth-Clibborn editions documenting the first ten years of their work. A second was published in 2004 by Thames and Hudson which documented another five years. They still strive to push the boundaries of graphic design and more recent projects collaborating with artist Gordon Young have moved them into the world of public art. In June 2013 a retrospective exhibition was held of their work at the GGG Gallery in Tokyo, Japan.
 Gordon Young is one of the UK’s leading artists in the field of public art. With over 20 years experience he has created projects as diverse as a series of 20m sculptural/climbing walls in Blackpool, a forest of typographic trees in Crawley Library, a Wall of Wishes in a Bristol school, and a cursing stone in Carlisle.
 Gordon's  most ambitious project to date is the Comedy Carpet, a 2,200m² granite typographical pavement made up of jokes, songs and catchphrases of comedians and writers which will is permanently set into the promenade in front of Blackpool Tower, England.
