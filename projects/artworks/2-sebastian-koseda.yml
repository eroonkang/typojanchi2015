 # ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

 Heal The Sick. Raise The Dead. Cleanse The Lepers. Cast Out Demons.

 It is believed by some scientists that there is a spiritual part of the brain that activates only when people pray or meditate.

 Inspired by the Christian Science Church, this piece explores the theme of 'When science meets religion' and the nuances surrounding this supposed oxymoron. The objective is to locate a visual that somehow conveys the collision of practices and then implement it typographically into the poster.

 The floating matter featured in the poster is a vector trace highlighting the parts of the brain that become active only when someone prays, the information was taken from a scan of brain activity whilst subject is praying.

 The poster produced is based on E Upper Wacker Dr Chicago, Illinois which features Harry Weese’s enigmatic building; The Seventeenth Church of Christ Scientist.

 I am a London based Graphic Designer focusing on speculative works that deal with themes of ethics, authorship & identity. In my practice I aim to merge graphic design with the satirical interrogation of contemporary culture.
