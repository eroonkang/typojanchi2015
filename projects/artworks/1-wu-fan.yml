 An Inquiry Manifesto
 This Inquiry Manifesto is part of the result of an interdisciplinary graphic design research project: Next City= ? =Nature. In this Manifesto we did not declare a static idea about future urban life; instead we sought to keep the plurality, complexity and contradiction of the answers. We are happy to explore and know this plural world through different Questions, and to see the process of raising questions via the specific method of Inquiry as a push force to the development of contemporary world, a force depicted by the Inquiry Manifesto.
 
 3000 Questions
 This is a book of questions but without answers. And the only thing about these questions in common is the inquiry of people’s situation. Inquiry is a fundamental way whereby man gets to know the world and explore himself. Inquiry itself is also an important part of human knowledge. This is a book that transcends borders, of ambitious collection and a chattering Utopian realist text, with which we attempt to measure the borders and outlines of human thinking, to depict human conditions in this real world, and to construct a second reality of our world in a text with an irrational yet logical language.
