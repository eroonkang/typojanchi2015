 We would like to propose an installation that explores the spacial potentials of typography.

 Ten black walls of equal width are set at equal distance from each other. The square structure equally divides the space into empty and filled areas.

 Walls are both the main structuring and socially dividing elements within a city. The installation explores the relationship between the private vs the public space, commenting on the dense feeling of large cities.

 The strict repetition of the walls and the alignment of the installation are informed by both architectural and typographic rules which eventually brings it back to the idea of design. 

 Alongside the spacial structure we would like to create a bespoke giveaway poster going hand in hand with the installation. It transfers the three dimensional piece back onto a flat surface.
