 For our presentation at the main exhibition of Typojanchi we  would love to play and interact with the neoclassical achitectural elements of the building. We propose to create a large scale typographic installation.Elements for the sculpture would be based on the title and the theme of the biennale.
 Our proposal is to literally take the elements of C( )T( ) and enlarge them into an playful architectural installation interacting with the pillars.
 The typographic elements would serve as a skin for reflecting statements on the theme city, street or public space.
