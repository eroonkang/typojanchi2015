 # ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------

artwork_desc_en: >
 For our presentation at the main exhibition of Typojanchi we  would love to play and interact with the neoclassical achitectural elements of the building. We propose to create a large scale typographic installation.Elements for the sculpture would be based on the title and the theme of the biennale.
 Our proposal is to literally take the elements of C( )T( ) and enlarge them into an playful architectural installation interacting with the pillars.
 The typographic elements would serve as a skin for reflecting statements on the theme city, street or public space.

 Studio Spass is a Rotterdam-based agency that works across print, branding, web and spatial design projects as well as animation and photography. Founded by Jaron Korvinus and Daan Mens in 2008, the studio combines a rigorous, considered and intelligent approach with a playful sensibility. 

 They understand that powerful and effective visual communication needs both original ideas and faultless execution, and the team prides itself on its perfectionist eye for the little details as well as its innovative conceptual thinking.  Jaron and Daan continue to oversee the studio’s output and have built a diverse team of specialists as well as a wider network of creatives on which they can draw.   

 Studio Spass works closely with clients and believes in genuine collaboration to develop the best visual solutions possible but that doesn’t mean slavishly following a brief – rather they like to challenge their clients and make sure their designs are answering the right questions.
