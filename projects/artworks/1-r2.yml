# ARTWORK -----------------------------------------------


artwork_desc_en: >
 Our graphic approach was based on several concepts that came from the brief and our experience of urbanity. Our proposal makes a paralel between architecture and typography. Not only its final form but also the process of making it, translates a series of concepts and contrasts that we find interesting: complexity in between spaces, strutuctures, perspectives, urbain voids and fulfillness.
 We used a portuguese word 'Futuro' ('Future', in english) that allow us to avoid redundancy, opening the possible readings. With this typographic approach we manage to make a direct connection with the theme.

# PARTICIPANT -----------------------------------------------

participant_bio_en: >
 R2 is a design studio based in Porto, Portugal, founded in 1995 by Lizá Defossez Ramalho and Artur Rebelo. R2’s work spans the areas of editorial design, visual identity, signage systems, posters, new media, video, exhibition design, and interventions in public spaces and buildings. 
 The essence of R2’s work lies in a dynamic creative process in which both designers equally engage from the initial stages through to the execution of a project. This complementary dialogue draws on thoughtful research and experimentation surrounding a given content for an ultimately concept-driven approach that lends form to a final product in which typography plays a fundamental role. 
 R2 explores static, sequential and interactive formats — through media as diverse as paper, concrete or digital —, and embraces collaborative ventures with other disciplines such as architecture, engineering, photography, writing or programming.
