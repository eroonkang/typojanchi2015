 Our graphic approach was based on several concepts that came from the brief and our experience of urbanity. Our proposal makes a paralel between architecture and typography. Not only its final form but also the process of making it, translates a series of concepts and contrasts that we find interesting: complexity in between spaces, strutuctures, perspectives, urbain voids and fulfillness.
 We used a portuguese word 'Futuro' ('Future', in english) that allow us to avoid redundancy, opening the possible readings. With this typographic approach we manage to make a direct connection with the theme.
